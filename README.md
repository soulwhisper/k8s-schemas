# k8s-schemas

A personal archive of Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) extracted from upstream.

## Usage

Schemas are served at `https://soulwhisper.github.io/k8s-schemas/` and can be used with tools like [kubeconform](https://github.com/yannh/kubeconform):

```yaml
# .kubeconform.yaml
schema-location:
  - default
  - "https://soulwhisper.github.io/k8s-schemas/{{.Group}}/{{.ResourceKind}}_{{.ResourceAPIVersion}}.json"
```
